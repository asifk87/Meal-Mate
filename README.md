# Meal-Mate
Have a bunch of produce in the fridge and not know what to make for dinner tonight or even meal prep for the week. Well, this app is designed to keep an inventory of whatâ€™s in your pantry and the produce available to you in the fridge and provide you with a list of recipes you can make for your meals. This will help people who struggle to with using their produce already in their friege and items already available to them in their pantry to build an easy meal for everyone.

# Navigation & Usage
For this project, I wanted to create a functional app that would be useful for everday people in an everyday use case. The challenge many people face is recipes to cook from with produce they already have in the fridge. I wanted to start the app where the user can search for an item they already have in the possession and the app would pull from a list recipes for them to review and pick from.

The user is able to keep a inventory of all the items they have available in their fridge and pantry.

The user is also able to keep a list of recipes that they can reference and also be able to search for on the main page.

# User Stories
- As a user, my opening page should show me currently planned recipes planned for the week.
- As a user, I would want to be able to input produce, and pantry items into app so that it creates a repository for all available items.
- As a user, I should be able to pick the major produce items so that the app can bring back recipes that the user can pick from.
- As a user, I should be able to pick a recipe and it will provide me with a list of items that I already have in the pantry/fridge and a separate list of items that I would need to purchase from the grocery store.

# Future Improvements and Goals
- Be able to plan meals for the week and get a grocery list for user to buy.
- Be able to use up items from produce and grocery list.
- Be able to scale the recipes to change proportions.
- Place recipes into categories.
